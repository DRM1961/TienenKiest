Instructions for the RPI used as MQTT broker and Display (see RPI for 2 choices below) PART1

>>first update/upgrade
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install 

>>install flask and mqtt libraries for web development
sudo apt install python3-flask
sudo apt install python3-flask-socketio
sudo apt install python3-paho-mqtt
sudo apt install python3-eventlet

>>install mosquito MQTT broker to transfer data & images
sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients

>>make it start at boot
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto.service

mosquitto -v
>>this shows version 2 and that only local connections are allowed

>>extend to allow outside connections with authentication
>> first time, we add a -c option to create a file with user-names
sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd rpi_display
>>enter (and repeat) a password: eg client

>>edit the mosquitto config file to add the password filename and port
>> (any text editor will do, but use sudo otherwise saving the file is not allowed)
sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

>>go to the end of the file and add these lines (if not yet present)
allow_anonymous false
listener 1883
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd

>>your file content should look as follows:
per_listener_settings true
pid_file /run/mosquitto/mosquitto.pid
persistence true
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/
log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log
include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d
allow_anonymous false
listener 1883
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd

>>then restart mosquitto service
sudo systemctl restart mosquitto

>>check that it is running (exit with ctl-C)
sudo systemctl status mosquitto

>>now add 2 users: rpi_voor, rpi_tegen
>>it will prompt for a password: use the same password: client 
sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd rpi_voor
sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd rpi_tegen

>>TEST MQTT ON LOCAL SYSTEM
>>get the rpi address which is in the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
hostname -I
>>let's say the result is 192.168.129.82, we'll use it later

>>open a terminal window and enter:
mosquitto_sub -d -t testTopic -u rpi_display -P client

>>in another terminal window enter:
mosquitto_pub -d -t  testTopic -m "ik ben rpi_voor" -u rpi_voor -P client
>>in the first terminal window the message should appear
>>in another terminal window enter:
mosquitto_pub -d -t  testTopic -m "ik ben rpi_tegen" -u rpi_tegen -P client
>>in the first terminal window the message should appear


>>TEST MQTT ON OTHER SYSTEM
>>on both RPIs for the tubes, install mosquitto-clients
sudo apt install mosquitto-clients

>>on rpi1, open a terminal window and enter on one:
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.129.82 -t "testTopic" -m "ik ben remote rpi_voor" -u rpi_voor -P client

>>do the same for rpi2
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.129.82 -t "testTopic" -m "ik ben remote rpi_tegen" -u rpi_tegen -P client

>>in both cases, the message should appear in the terminal window of the main rpi.


>> subscribe to file
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.129.82 -t testFile -u rpi_display -P client
>>publish a file
mosquitto_pub -d -h 192.168.129.82 -t  testFile -f ~/dev/todo.txt -u rpi_voor -P client
